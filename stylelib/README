These style files go in ~/.config/matplotlib/stylelib (or the equivalent on
non-Unix systems); to activate the corresponding style, just use

    import matplotlib as mpl
    mpl.style.use('notebook_view') # for example; other styles are available

You may need to reload matplotlib, if it was already running, to get it to
notice the new style files.

Many of these styles require certain system fonts to be available.  At the very
least, the Linux Libertine and Biolinum families are recommended; they can be
dowloaded at libertine-fonts.org .
